There are many ways to add customized style to any html element.

The aspects that we can change are defined in a simple language called CSS, Cascading Style Sheets.

CSS properties can be added to an html document in many different places, but the simplest is directly inline with the element being modified.

```
<html>
  <head>
  </head>

  <body>
    <p>
      This is unstyled text.
    </p>
    
    <p style="color:red">
      This is styled text.
    </p>
  </body>
</html>
```
