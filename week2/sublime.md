###Week 1: Permissions Improvement

-----

We have become comfortable navigating our server and creating content with `cd`, `ls`, `mkdir`, `touch`. We've also used `echo "content" > file.txt` to replace text in a file and `echo "content" >> file.txt` to append.

Being comfortable with these tools is fundamental, but of course there are better to edit text. Imagine needing to construct a complex website with just `echo` at our disposal!

Another useful command in Bash is `nano`, which is a very small and simple [hence the name!] text editor.


```
ssh -i ~/.ssh/identity.pem ubuntu@elasticIPaddress
```
Let's connect to our server
