###Week 1: Permissions Improvement

-----

Our server as setup last week requires us to use `sudo` to create and edit files on the server, since the `ubuntu` user does not by default have write access to the `/var/www/html` directory. 


```
ssh -i ~/.ssh/identity.pem ubuntu@elasticIPaddress
```
Connect to the server.

```
sudo adduser ubuntu www-data
```
The apache web server uses the www-data group to manage who can edit served files. This line adds the `ubuntu` user to that group.

```
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www
```
This line ensures that the www-data group owns the /var/www folder, so that our new group membership applies to all subfolders of `/var/www`.

```
sudo chmod -R g+rwX /var/www
```
Change permissions on the directory. We are adding to the `g`roup that our current user belongs to `r`ead,`w`rite, and e`X`ecute permissions. Read more about how chmod works by running  `man chown`. 

```
exit
ssh -i ~/.ssh/identity.pem ubuntu@elasticIPaddress
```
Disconnect from the server, and reconnect for these changes to take effect.
