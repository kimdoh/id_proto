###Inline Elements

-----

In addition to block-level elements, which take up 100% of the horizontal space on the page, there also exists elements which can sit next to one another. These are called *inline elements*. We have already used one: the anchor `<a>` tag.

`<abbr>` Element

```

  <head>

```
