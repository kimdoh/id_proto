###Adding Content

We've created the `post type `. Now, add some pages to the Content pane of the Prismic interface. Ensure you add a few `post` pages, and fill in all of the fields required. 

Be careful with `uid`s. These cannot begin with a number or special character, and should be all lowercase. 

Make sure you *publish* the content before moving on.

Let's return to [writing some code](base.html) to setup our page.
