###Standing Up a Server

The goal of the exercises today is to stand up an http server on Amazon Web Services [AWS]. An http server is a computer (real or virtual) that exists for the simple purpose of handling requests over the http protocol from web browsers and other access points.

When web browsers type in a domain name, DNS services convert that domain name into an IP address, and the computer's request is routed to the server associated with that address. Depending on the content and settings on the server, the server then performs actions and returns results to the requesting machine. 

Amazon offers services via AWS that drives a significant proportion of the internet. We are using it in class because of its free tier and genericness, but other options are available such as the recommendable [Dreamhost](http://www.dreamhost.com) and [HostGator](http://www.hostgator.com). [Google Cloud Computing](http://www.cloud.google.com) is a competing service as well.
