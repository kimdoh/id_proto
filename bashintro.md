If you visit the IP address associated with your instance, your web browser will report an error, as we have yet to install and setup web server software on the machine.

We'll need to access the machine to do so, and that requires a trip to your computer's terminal.

> On Macs or Linux machines, open `Terminal` from the Applications Folder. The directions will assume macOS from here on.

> On Windows, install [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com) and the [ssh daemon](http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/41560/how-to-get-ssh-command-line-access-to-windows-7-using-cygwin/)

The Terminal is a way of controlling your computer without any graphical user elements. You type in commands, and the machine responds with text back to you.

macOS uses a Terminal dialect called [Bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)) which is derived from its Unix ancestry. The Bash language that we will be writing is [very concise](http://ss64.com/bash/).

After Terminal launches, it will present you with a prompt.

```
htpcs-Mac-mini:~ htpc$ 
```
